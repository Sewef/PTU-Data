If you roll 3 times without success, the bait loses its potency and fails. If you succeed however, a random Pok\u00e9mon, based on your GM's discretion will appear. The Pok\u00e9mon attracted with bait should usually be of a Level comparable to the party's Pok\u00e9mon. Bait is often used for Fishing in this way.\nTo distract Pok\u00e9mon, throw it at a Wild Pok\u00e9mon as a Standard Action. The target must then make a Focus Roll with a DC of 12.
