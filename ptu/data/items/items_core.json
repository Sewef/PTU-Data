It emits a string of energy that is used in a similar fashion to a lasso but is too weak to physically restrain a target.

Acquiring a Capture Styler is easy for those who become certified Pokémon Rangers; most qualified Rangers receive one as part of the job. They are not for sale to the general public and may cost upwards of ₽7500 on the black market due to their iconic nature - it's easy to assume that someone who has a Capture Styler is a Ranger."
