<h1>Cheerleader</h1>
<p>Cheerleader</p>
<p>[Class] </p>
<p>Prerequisites: Inspired Training, Novice Charm</p>
<p>X AP – Free Action</p>
<p>Trigger: You use Orders</p>
<p>Effect: Choose Cheered, Excited, or Motivated. All allies affected by the triggering effect gain the chosen condition. </p>
<p>This Feature costs 0 AP if the triggering effect affects only one ally, and costs 1 AP if it affects two or more.</p>
<p>Mechanic: Cheerleader’s Features can deliver several beneficial conditions on their allies – Cheered, Excited, or </p>
<p>Motivated. Targets can have more than once “instance” of the same condition, but for Cheered and Excited only </p>
<p>one instance may be activated per trigger (that is to say, you can’t add +10 Damage Reduction against one attack </p>
<p>using Excited, and you can’t use Cheered to roll four times for the same Save Check!)</p>
<p>»»</p>
<p>Cheered – Pokémon or Trainers may give up the Cheered condition when making a Save Check to roll twice, </p>
<p>and take the best result.</p>
<p>»»</p>
<p>Excited – Pokémon or Trainers may give up the Excited condition when hit by a Damaging Attack to gain +5 </p>
<p>Damage Reduction against that attack.</p>
<p>»»</p>
<p>Motivated – Pokémon or Trainers may give up the Motivated condition as a Free Action to increase a Combat </p>
<p>Stage that is below its Default Value (usually 0 CS) by +1 CS. </p>
