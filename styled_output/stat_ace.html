<p>Stat Ace</p>

<p>Focus</p>
<p>Prerequisites: 3 Pokémon with the chosen stat at 20 or higher, Novice Command or Focus</p>
<p>Static</p>
<p>Effect: Your Pokémon have their Chosen Base Stat increased by +1, and by +1 more for every 10 Levels they have </p>
<p>(for example, a Level 20 Pokémon would have your Chosen Stat’s base value increased by +3). Additionally, your </p>
<p>Pokémon may ignore Base Relations, as long as they are adding to the Stat chosen for Stat Ace, and you do not need </p>
<p>to “correct” Stats due to this inflated Stat Value.</p>
<p>Note: When you take Stat Ace, choose Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, or Speed. This becomes </p>
<p>your Pokémon’s Chosen Stat. You may take Stat Ace multiple times, choosing different Stats each time. If using </p>
<p>Style Expert to qualify for Stat Ace, your Chosen Stat must be the Stat that correlates to your Chosen Contest Stat. </p>
<p>Beauty is Special Attack, Cool is Attack, Cute is Speed, Smart is Special Defense, and Tough is Defense. </p>
