<p>Trained until an Extended Rest is taken.  The default State of Trained Stats is +1 Combat Stages instead of 0. A </p>
<p>Pokémon may have only one Trained Stat at a time.</p>
<p>Note: Just to clarify, this Feature Drains 1 AP per training session, not per Pokémon. So train as many as you can </p>
<p>to get the most out of this Feature!</p>

<p>Trigger: Your Pokémon gains an Injury</p>

<p>Focused Training, or Inspired Training. You gain </p>
<p>the chosen Feature, even if you do not meet the </p>
<p>prerequisites.  When training, you may apply up to two </p>
<p>different [Training] Features on each of your Pokémon. </p>
<p>If you already have all of these Features, instead pick </p>
<p>another Feature for which you qualify.</p>

<p>Target: Your Pokémon with at least 2 Tutor Points </p>
<p>remaining</p>
<p>Effect: The target loses 2 Tutor Points. Choose one </p>
<p>Move on the Target’s Move List. That Move becomes </p>
<p>the target’s Signature Technique, and you may apply </p>
<p>one of the modifications on the next page to the Move. </p>
<p>The Move being modified must fit the category of the </p>
<p>modification, and you must have the associated Training </p>
<p>Feature to apply a modification. A Pokémon may only </p>
<p>have one Signature Technique at a time. If you choose </p>
<p>to teach a Pokémon a different Signature Technique, the </p>
<p>old one is lost, and 1 Tutor Point is refunded. 1 Tutor </p>
<p>Point is also refunded if the Pokémon ever forgets a </p>
<p>Signature Technique Move.</p>

<p>Innovation Moves</p>
<p>The Coordinator’s “Innovation” Feature lets the Coordinator create new Moves for their Pokémon. These Moves </p>
<p>can serve to fill voids in Move Lists for both Battles and Contests and provide utility.</p>
<p>To create a Move, first choose a Contest Type. This affects the Move’s effects and of course its role in Contests.</p>
<p>Next choose a Contest Effect. Look at the “Contest Effects” section (page 266) under “Contests” for the full list. </p>
<p>Pick one. That’s right, any of them. This determines what the Move does during a Contest, of course.</p>
<p>Third, choose one of the four templates below. This determines the Move’s effects in Battle. These are modified by </p>
<p>the Contest Type of the Move. Remember, Cool is associated with Attack, Tough with Defense, Beauty with Special </p>
<p>Attack, Smart with Special Defense, and Cute with Speed.</p>
<p>And finally, name your Move! This is the best part!</p>

<p>Battling Style Classes: These Classes are dedicated to particular battling styles. Choosing one of these Classes will </p>
<p>make a big statement about how your character approaches Pokémon training and battles. Unlike the Specialist </p>
<p>Team Classes, choosing a Battling Style Class does not require you to become highly selective about your Pokémon </p>

<p>Class as a foundation easily transition into taking one of these Classes to specialize and develop further.</p>

<p>Active Pokémon Support: </p>
<p>Passive Pokémon Support: </p>
<p>One of four Classes based on the four Training Features, Duelist hones in on the Focused Training Feature and </p>

<p>a steady advantage using one Pokémon at a time without much switching. </p>
<p>Enduring Soul</p>
<p>Skills: Athletics, Focus</p>
<p>Passive Pokémon Support: </p>
<p>A defensive Class that seeks to outlast its opponents, the Enduring Soul can give even the most frail Pokémon </p>

<p>of the day. </p>
<p>Juggler</p>
<p>Skills: Acrobatics</p>
<p>Active Pokémon Support: </p>
<p>Jugglers swiftly swap through their entire Pokémon teams in a fight, forcing opponents to keep on their toes. </p>

<p>Active Pokémon Support: </p>
<p>Trainer Combat: </p>

<p>Skills: Intimidate</p>
<p>Active Pokémon Support: </p>
<p>Passive Pokémon Support: </p>
<p>One of four Classes based on the four Training Features, Taskmaster embraces the cruel battling style of the </p>

<p>their own Pokémon Injuries through a grueling training regime. </p>
<p>Trickster</p>
<p>Skills: Guile</p>
<p>Active Pokémon Support: </p>
<p>Passive Pokémon Support: </p>
<p>Tricksters are specialists in commanding their Pokémon to use Status-Class Moves, whether they are inflicting </p>

<p>Combat Stage reducing Moves. </p>

<p>were your own memories.</p>

<p>darkness if in darkness, or to make yourself look like </p>
<p>a mundane object (such as a crate, potted plant, or </p>
<p>similar). The Illusion can even fool Aura, concealing </p>
<p>you from Aura Sight for its duration. However, the </p>
<p>Illusion requires complete concentration, and is broken </p>
<p>if you take any actions at all. Anyone that interacts with </p>
<p>the Illusion directly may make an Occult Education or </p>
<p>Intuition Check with a DC equal to 10 plus your Stealth </p>
<p>Rank; if they succeed, the Illusion is broken.</p>

<p>the Move’s usual area of effect, you leave one square of </p>
<p>Smokescreen, Spikes, or Toxic Spikes on each square you </p>

<p>Target: Self</p>
<p>Effect: The user has a vision, dream, or similar that may </p>

<p>it. See the next page for more details.</p>

<p>unclear, to the discretion of your GM. See the next page </p>
<p>for more details.</p>
<p>Unveiled Sight</p>
<p>[+Special Defense]</p>
<p>Prerequisites: Oracle</p>
<p>Static</p>
<p>Effect: You can see through Illusions. This means </p>
<p>you can spot Illusions from the Illusionist capability, </p>
<p>Illusion Ability, and Genjutsu Feature as being fake. </p>
<p>You are immune to Moves with the Illusion keyword, </p>
<p>Double Team cannot be activated against you, and you </p>
<p>bypass Substitutes. As a Standard Action, you can create </p>
<p>a Burst 4, dispelling all Illusion effects within.</p>
<p>Disguises and Illusions: Disguises in general refer to </p>
<p>things with physical components; a mundane disguise </p>
<p>would be the kind with props and fake moustaches and </p>
<p>the like. An example of a magical disguise would be a </p>
<p>Ditto’s transformation. Illusions are magical effects, </p>
<p>such as the Move Double Team, Substitute, or the </p>
<p>Illusion Ability.</p>

<p>Prerequisites: Oracle, Adept Perception</p>

<p>Target: A willing Trainer</p>
<p>Effect: You mark the target with a mystical power which </p>
<p>allows you to close your eyes and focus to perceive the </p>
<p>world with their senses from their perspective. You may </p>
<p>Bind this Ability multiple times, each time on a different </p>
<p>target, but you may only concentrate on one Mark of </p>
<p>Vision at a time, and you may only have a number of </p>
<p>Marks at one time equal to half your Perception Rank. </p>
<p>A target may choose to end this effect at any time, or </p>
<p>to deny you access to their senses temporarily without </p>
<p>ending the effect entirely. You have a rough sense of </p>
<p>how far away and in what direction marked targets are. </p>

<p>GM’s of the world! It’s up to you to make Scrying and </p>
<p>Augury fun, and “worth it”.  So here’s some advice.</p>
<p>First, you and your player should negotiate their PC’s </p>
<p>method for scrying and making auguries. Maybe they </p>
<p>need to read tea leaves to use this ability; or gaze into </p>
<p>open flames. Maybe they trigger it “Accidentally” </p>
<p>while sleeping, or during another mundane activity. </p>
<p>Maybe they need to pry information from an enigmatic </p>
<p>Spiritomb that appears to them after they light a </p>
<p>candle and say a prayer. If you want to be thoroughly </p>
<p>boring, maybe they only need to focus on activating </p>
<p>their mystic abilities. Have fun with coming up with </p>
<p>a method; it should be something that’s relatively easy </p>
<p>to do though, regardless of their location (don’t make </p>
<p>them have to buy expensive items to do it each time, or </p>
<p>to scale a specific mountain in the region just to activate </p>
<p>this ability!).</p>
<p>Next, consider how you as a GM want to give </p>
<p>information. You shouldn’t feel obligated to spoil plot </p>
<p>points that you don’t want to hand out; at the same time, </p>
<p>this is a great way to give information to a PC that you </p>
<p>DO want them to know. Don’t be afraid to make things </p>
<p>vague enough that they don’t make sense at the time, </p>
<p>but do make sense later; don’t ALWAYS do this though, </p>
<p>or the warnings given to them by their powers will feel </p>
<p>more like taunts if they never realize their meaning </p>
<p>until it’s too late to do anything about it.</p>
<p>Scrying is the more straightforward effect and shouldn’t </p>
<p>be too difficult. Simply consider how you want to </p>
<p>present the information. Augury is a bit more subtle. </p>
<p>Again, don’t be afraid to be vague occasionally, or to </p>
<p>give incomplete information (e.g. - “You gain a feeling </p>
<p>you shouldn’t trust &lt;insert name here&gt;, but you don’t </p>
<p>know why” or “You see a rare herd of Kangaskhan and </p>
<p>sense that they’re nearby, but you don’t know in which </p>
<p>direction” are examples of perfectly acceptable visions). </p>

<p>Target: Blessings you generated with a Sage Move</p>
<p>Effect: Choose a type of Blessing you can generate with </p>
<p>a Sage Move. All Blessings you generated of another </p>
<p>type become Blessings of the chosen type. This may not </p>
<p>be used to generate more uses of a Blessing than the </p>
<p>original Move creates. For example, three Lucky Chant </p>
<p>Blessings would become two Reflect or Light Screen </p>
<p>Blessings, not three. You may only choose a Blessing </p>

<p>Bind 1 AP – Standard Action</p>
<p>Effect: You may also wield weapons and items with </p>
<p>your Telekinesis capability, as long as you are able to </p>
<p>lift them. This means you may use Items and Melee </p>
<p>Weapons that normally require you to be adjacent to </p>
<p>your target at a range limited only by your Telekinesis. </p>
<p>When wielding Weapons with your Telekinesis, you </p>
<p>qualify for Moves using Focus instead of Combat and </p>

<p>Confused. </p>
<p>»»</p>
<p>Barrier: Place 2 additional segments of Barrier, and </p>
<p>you may place the Barriers anywhere within 6 meters </p>
<p>of yourself. They do not need to remain contiguous, </p>
<p>nor does one segment have to touch you. </p>
<p>»»</p>
<p>Psychic: The target becomes Vulnerable for one full </p>
<p>round. </p>
<p>»»</p>
<p>Telekinesis: At the end of each turn that the target </p>
<p>remains Lifted, they lose a Tick of Hit Points.</p>
<p>Telepath</p>
<p>[Class] [+Special Defense]</p>
<p>Prerequisites: Elemental Connection (Psychic), Iron Mind, Novice Intuition </p>

<p>Honed Mind</p>
<p>[+Special Defense]</p>
<p>Prerequisites: Telepath</p>

<p>Humans or Pokémon within X meters of yourself; X is </p>

<p>Ability. You may only use Thought Detection as long as </p>
<p>you have the Telepathy Capability. </p>
<p>Telepathic Warning</p>
<p>[+Special Defense]</p>
<p>Prerequisites: Telepathic Awareness, Expert Focus or </p>
<p>Intuition</p>
<p>1 AP – Free Action</p>
<p>Trigger: You or an Ally use an Attack</p>
<p>Effect: You’re able to give your allies heed of attacks. </p>
<p>All allies that would be hit by the attack may take a </p>
<p>Shift Action as an Interrupt to move out of the area </p>
<p>of effect of the attack. Using this leaves discoverable </p>
<p>Psychic Residue on each affected ally. You may only use </p>
<p>Telepathic Warning as long as you have the Telepath </p>
<p>Capability.</p>
<p>Mental Assault</p>
<p>[+Special Defense]</p>

<p>[+Special Defense]</p>
<p>Prerequisites: Honed Mind, Master Focus or Intuition</p>
<p>Bind 1 AP – Standard Action</p>
<p>Target: Pokémon or Trainers</p>
<p>Effect: You smoothly plant a thought into the subject’s </p>
<p>head that lasts as long as this Feature is Bound. They </p>
<p>won’t know exactly why or how they thought of it; they </p>
<p>will naturally assume they thought of it themselves, and </p>
<p>their brain will attempt to get there as logically as it can. </p>
<p>The target may not necessarily act on the Suggestion, </p>
<p>especially if it is against their nature. Using Suggestion </p>
<p>to plant a specific thought may cause the target to </p>
<p>think about a specific subject, dredging up surface </p>
<p>thoughts related to the matter. Using this on a target </p>
<p>leaves discoverable psychic residue. You may only use </p>
<p>Suggestion as long as you have the Telepathy Capability, </p>
<p>though you may keep it Bound without having Telepathy </p>
<p>active. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Warper</p>

<p>Trigger: You use the Move Teleport or activate the </p>
<p>Teleporter Capability</p>
<p>Choose One Effect: You activate Teleporter as if your </p>
<p>Teleporter value were three times its normal value or </p>
<p>you may take one willing Pokémon or Trainer along </p>
<p>with you as you teleport so long as you are touching </p>
<p>them when you activate Farcast. You may expend two </p>
<p>uses of Farcast at once to choose both effects.</p>
<p>Warped Transmission</p>
<p>[+Speed]</p>
<p>Prerequisites: Farcast, Master Guile</p>
<p>2 AP – Swift Action</p>
<p>Trigger: You activate the Teleporter Capability or use </p>
<p>the Move Ally Switch</p>
<p>Effect: All adjacent foes to the square you end in after </p>
<p>teleporting or using Ally Switch have their Evasion </p>
<p>lowered by 3 for one full round and cannot trigger </p>
<p>Attacks of Opportunity against you for Shifting until </p>
<p>the end of your next turn.</p>
<p>Reality Bender </p>
<p>[+Speed]</p>
<p>Prerequisites: Warper, Expert Guile</p>
<p>Daily – Free Action</p>
<p>Effect: You are able to subconsciously alter the fabric </p>
<p>of reality to change small facts or circumstances. If </p>
<p>your character is confronting a “random” event such as </p>
<p>a die roll, coin flip, or cards being dealt, the character </p>
<p>may activate this Feature to influence the event. In </p>
<p>this scenario, the GM provides you with two possible </p>
<p>outcomes, and you pick one of them to actually occur. </p>
<p>This means you always decide the outcome of binary </p>
<p>events such as a coin flip; cheating cards or slot machines </p>
<p>is much harder, as there are multiple outcomes and you </p>
<p>only get to pick between two. This Feature can also be </p>
<p>used to generate common items worth $250 or less that </p>
<p>the character might normally possess, such as a Potion </p>
<p>or Poké Ball, when in a pinch. The character just happens </p>
<p>to find the needed item among their belongings. This </p>
<p>Feature can only create items you wish to use at that </p>
<p>moment, and of which you have none available; such as </p>
<p>needing to heal a Pokémon but having no Potions left. </p>
<p>Items created with Reality Bender must be used quickly </p>
<p>after activating the feature and cannot be stored for later.</p>
<p>Doxy: To be clear, this Feature refers to die rolls –in </p>
<p>game-, not any die rolls used to PLAY the </p>
<p>game. Also, GMs are encouraged to whap </p>
<p>any Warpers on the nose with a rolled up </p>
<p>newspaper if they try to apply to this to combat… </p>
<p>except, perhaps, if they or their Pokémon attempts to </p>
<p>use the Move Metronome…</p>
