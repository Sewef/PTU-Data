<p>Thought Detection</p>
<p>[+Special Defense]</p>
<p>Prerequisites: Telepathic Awareness </p>
<p>Scene – Standard Action</p>
<p>Effect: You become aware of the number of living </p>
<p>Humans or Pokémon within X meters of yourself; X is </p>
<p>equal to your Focus Rank tripled. Pokémon or Trainers </p>
<p>with the Mindlock Capability are not detected by this </p>
<p>Ability. You may only use Thought Detection as long as </p>
<p>you have the Telepathy Capability. </p>
<p>Telepathic Warning</p>
<p>[+Special Defense]</p>
<p>Prerequisites: Telepathic Awareness, Expert Focus or </p>
<p>Intuition</p>
<p>1 AP – Free Action</p>
<p>Trigger: You or an Ally use an Attack</p>
<p>Effect: You’re able to give your allies heed of attacks. </p>
<p>All allies that would be hit by the attack may take a </p>
<p>Shift Action as an Interrupt to move out of the area </p>
<p>of effect of the attack. Using this leaves discoverable </p>
<p>Psychic Residue on each affected ally. You may only use </p>
<p>Telepathic Warning as long as you have the Telepath </p>
<p>Capability.</p>

<p>[+Special Defense]</p>
<p>Prerequisites: Honed Mind, Master Focus or Intuition</p>
<p>Bind 1 AP – Standard Action</p>
<p>Target: Pokémon or Trainers</p>
<p>Effect: You smoothly plant a thought into the subject’s </p>
<p>head that lasts as long as this Feature is Bound. They </p>
<p>won’t know exactly why or how they thought of it; they </p>
<p>will naturally assume they thought of it themselves, and </p>
<p>their brain will attempt to get there as logically as it can. </p>
<p>The target may not necessarily act on the Suggestion, </p>
<p>especially if it is against their nature. Using Suggestion </p>
<p>to plant a specific thought may cause the target to </p>
<p>think about a specific subject, dredging up surface </p>
<p>thoughts related to the matter. Using this on a target </p>
<p>leaves discoverable psychic residue. You may only use </p>
<p>Suggestion as long as you have the Telepathy Capability, </p>
<p>though you may keep it Bound without having Telepathy </p>
<p>active. </p>
