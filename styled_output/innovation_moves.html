<h1>Innovation Moves</h1>
<p>Innovation Moves</p>
<p>The Coordinator’s “Innovation” Feature lets the Coordinator create new Moves for their Pokémon. These Moves </p>
<p>can serve to fill voids in Move Lists for both Battles and Contests and provide utility.</p>
<p>To create a Move, first choose a Contest Type. This affects the Move’s effects and of course its role in Contests.</p>
<p>Next choose a Contest Effect. Look at the “Contest Effects” section (page 266) under “Contests” for the full list. </p>
<p>Pick one. That’s right, any of them. This determines what the Move does during a Contest, of course.</p>
<p>Third, choose one of the four templates below. This determines the Move’s effects in Battle. These are modified by </p>
<p>the Contest Type of the Move. Remember, Cool is associated with Attack, Tough with Defense, Beauty with Special </p>
<p>Attack, Smart with Special Defense, and Cute with Speed.</p>
<p>And finally, name your Move! This is the best part!</p>
