<h1>Normal Ace Features</h1>
<p>Normal Ace Features</p>
<p>Extra Ordinary </p>
<p>Prerequisites: Type Ace, Normal as Chosen Type</p>
<p>At-Will – Extended Action</p>
<p>Target: Your Normal-Type Pokémon with Last Chance </p>
<p>or Normal Strategist</p>
<p>Effect: Your Pokémon gains the Last Chance or Normal </p>
<p>Strategist Ability, whichever one they do not already </p>
<p>have. Extra Ordinary can target a Pokémon only once.</p>
<p>Plainly Perfect</p>
<p>[Orders] [Stratagem]</p>
<p>Prerequisites: Extra Ordinary, Type-Linked Skill at </p>
<p>Adept</p>
<p>Bind 2 AP – Standard Action</p>
<p>Target: Your Pokémon</p>
<p>Effect: While this Feature is bound, instead of rolling </p>
<p>for damage with Normal-Type Moves, your Pokémon </p>
<p>acts as if they rolled the maximum value on their </p>
<p>Damage Dice Roll. Plainly Perfect only works for the </p>
<p>first instance of the Damage Dice Roll on Critical Hits.</p>
<p>New Normal</p>
<p>Prerequisites: Extra Ordinary, Type-Linked Skill at </p>
<p>Expert</p>
<p>Scene x2 – Free Action</p>
<p>Trigger: Your Pokémon hits with a Normal-Type Move </p>
<p>with conditional modifiers which increase or decrease </p>
<p>its damage</p>
<p>Effect: You use the highest damage value for the </p>
<p>triggering Move. (Examples: Return is DB 9, Wring Out </p>
<p>never has its damage decreased due to the target’s Hit </p>
<p>Points, Retaliate is DB 14) New Normal may only be </p>
<p>used once per Scene per Pokémon. New Normal may </p>
<p>not raise a Move’s Damage Base above 14; if a Move </p>
<p>would have its Damage Base raised above that value, it </p>
<p>is instead raised to 14. </p>
<p>Simple Improvements </p>
<p>Prerequisites: Extra Ordinary, Type-Linked Skill at </p>
<p>Master</p>
<p>Daily x3 – Free Action</p>
<p>Trigger: Your Normal-Type Pokémon gains Initiative</p>

<p>your Pokémon’s rolls this turn. Your Pokémon gains </p>
<p>Temporary Hit Points equal to twice your Type-Linked </p>
<p>Skill Rank. Simple Improvements may only be used </p>
<p>once per Scene per Pokémon. </p>

<p>a foe</p>
<p>Effect: The foe does not necessarily lose Special Defense </p>
<p>Combat Stages from Poison; instead, they lose Combat </p>
<p>Stages in the Combat Stat of your choice. Whenever the </p>
<p>target loses Hit Points from Poison, they lose additional </p>
<p>Hit Points equal to your Type-Linked Skill Rank.</p>

<p>Effect: Your Pokémon may use either Smokescreen </p>
<p>or Poison Gas as if they were on their Move List. </p>
<p>When used this way, these Moves ignore Frequency </p>
<p>Limitations, and are used as a Ranged Blast 3,  with the </p>
<p>blast centered on the square targeted by the triggering </p>
<p>attack. Poison-Type Pokémon are not negatively affected </p>
<p>by Smoke Screens created this way. Your Pokémon may </p>
