<p>Effect: You may craft any Fashionista Recipe for which you qualify.</p>

<p>one Equipment or Held Item you can create. While </p>
<p>this Feature is Bound, the target gains the effects of the </p>
<p>chosen item, as long as they would normally be able to </p>
<p>equip it (ex: Trainers cannot equip Incense Items).They </p>
<p>do not need to take up an Equipment or Held Item slot </p>
<p>to gain this benefit. A target may only be affected by one </p>
<p>instance of Dashing Makeover at a time. </p>
<p>Style is Eternal</p>
<p>Prerequisites: Fashionista</p>
<p>1 AP – Free Action</p>
<p>Trigger: Your Pokémon is Disarmed or would have </p>
<p>their Held Item removed by another effect such as Thief </p>

<p>Slot Items at once. The two items must be of different </p>
<p>types and must not share an effect. For example, a Fire </p>
<p>Brace cannot be paired with another Fire Brace or a Fire </p>
<p>Plate, but it could be paired with an Ice Brace, a Fire </p>
<p>Booster, or a Stat Booster.</p>
<p>Parfumier</p>

<p>chic. Chic Pokémon gain two extra Held Item slots with </p>
<p>which they can carry Held Items. However, the items in </p>
<p>these slots have no effect and are not treated as equipped. </p>
<p>As a Swift Action on their turn, Chic Pokémon may </p>
<p>swap a currently active Held Item with an item stored in </p>
<p>these slots. Chic Pokémon may not carry multiple items </p>
<p>of the same type or with repeated effects. </p>
<p>Note: A Chic Pokémon does not become Suppressed </p>
<p>until they switch a Choice Item into their active Held </p>
<p>Item slot, but even if they then switch the Choice Item </p>
<p>out, they remain Suppressed for the remainder of </p>
<p>combat. A Mega-Evolved Chic Pokémon remains Mega-</p>
<p>Evolved even if they switch their active Held Item.</p>
