<h1>Enduring Soul</h1>
<p>Enduring Soul</p>
<p>[Class]</p>
<p>Prerequisites: Novice Athletics and Focus </p>
<p>Static</p>
<p>Effect: You may add to your Pokémon’s HP stat when they level up, ignoring Base Relation, and you do not need </p>

<p>Staying Power</p>
<p>Prerequisites:  Enduring Soul</p>
<p>Scene – Free Action</p>
<p>Trigger: Your Pokémon Takes a Breather</p>
<p>Effect:  Your Pokémon may “Take a Breather” even if </p>
<p>it is Confused or Enraged, and it does not Trip or have </p>
<p>to Shift away from enemies as part of the action. You </p>
<p>may choose whether or not your Pokémon resets their </p>
<p>Combat Stages to default.</p>
<p>Shrug Off</p>
<p>Prerequisites: Staying Power</p>

<p>may also be activated as a Free Action whenever your </p>
<p>Pokémon Take a Breather.</p>

<p>Status Affliction (or both)</p>
<p>Effect: Your Pokémon does not gain a Status Affliction, </p>

<p>Injury, and may then use a Move as an Interrupt. When </p>
<p>the Move is resolved, the Pokémon then immediately </p>
<p>faints. This consumes a Pokémon turn as normal. This </p>
