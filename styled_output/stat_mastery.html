<h1>Stat Mastery</h1>
<p>Stat Mastery</p>
<p>[Branch]</p>
<p>Prerequisites: Stat Maneuver</p>

<p>Effect: Stat Mastery’s Effect depends on your Chosen </p>
<p>Stat:</p>
<p>Attack Effect: When your Pokémon successfully uses </p>
<p>a Push, Disarm, or Dirty Trick Combat Maneuver, the </p>
<p>target of the Maneuver loses a Tick of Hit Points.</p>
<p>Defense Effect: Whenever your Pokémon do not spend </p>
<p>their Shift Action to Shift during a turn, they gain +5 </p>
<p>Damage Reduction for one full round.</p>
<p>Special Attack Effect: The Range of your Pokémon’s </p>
<p>Special Non-Melee Moves is increased by +2. This does </p>
<p>not affect the size of Area-Of-Effect moves (But does </p>
<p>affect the range at which you can place Ranged Blasts).</p>
<p>Special Defense Effect: Whenever your Pokémon </p>
<p>would lose a Tick of Hit Points from Status Afflictions, </p>
<p>Weather, or other effects, they lose 5 fewer Hit Points, to </p>
<p>a minimum of 1. </p>

<p>Maneuvers as Swift Actions.</p>
