<p>Trigger: You hit with Leer, Confide, Baby-Doll Eyes, or </p>
<p>a Provocateur Move</p>
<p>Effect: The Move gains additional effects as listed below. </p>
<p>You may use the effects of each Move only once per </p>
<p>Scene.</p>
<p>»»</p>
<p>Baby-Doll Eyes: The target becomes Infatuated </p>
<p>with you for the rest of the Scene, and cannot be </p>
<p>cured of this condition by any means, including </p>
<p>Taking a Breather. This does not bypass immunity </p>
<p>to Infatuation.</p>
<p>»»</p>
<p>Confide: You choose a Move the target has used this </p>
<p>Scene. That Move becomes Disabled for the target.</p>
<p>»»</p>

<p>Combat Stage, and their Special Defense is lowered </p>
<p>by 2 Combat Stages.</p>
<p>»»</p>
<p>Sweet Kiss: While the target is Confused, they may </p>
<p>not perform Disengage Maneuvers, and whenever </p>
<p>they hit themselves in Confusion, they provoke an </p>
<p>Attack of Opportunity from all of their adjacent </p>
<p>foes.</p>
<p>»»</p>
<p>Taunt: For 1 full round, the next damaging attack to </p>
<p>hit the target of Taunt deals +3d8+10 Damage.</p>
<p>»»</p>
<p>Torment: The target’s Ability is disabled until the </p>
<p>end of the encounter. If the target has more than one </p>
<p>Ability, you choose one of them to disable.</p>
<p>»»</p>
<p>Lovely Kiss: The target’s Evasion is lowered by 2 for </p>
<p>the rest of the Scene.</p>
